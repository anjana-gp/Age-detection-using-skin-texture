# Age-detection-using-skin-texture
Analysing an individual's hand skin texture to determine their age group. A deep learning sequential CNN model is used for identification.
The dorsal section of the hand photos are handpicked and organised into three categories: test, train, and validation.
These train and validation photos are scaled and delivered to a sequential CNN model with 9 layers for training and an epoch size of 20. After training the model, a real-time prediction on the dorsal half of the image is made.
